A CLI for wizard.

:warning: `This project is no longer in active development. It was a way for me to try out new tools.`

Wizard was an attempt at making a CLI tool that spins up new projects using pre-defined templates. The idea behind was to allow for different building blocks to be put together depending on the needs of a project (such as authentication).
